               <p class="zagolovok5">Deadpool (video game)</p>
                <p class="elo4">Deadpool is an antihero action comedy beat 'em up video game based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. The game was developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Former Deadpool comic writer Daniel Way created the game's plot, and Nolan North voiced the character. The game received mixed to positive reviews, with plot elements commonly praised and gameplay elements found lacking.Deadpool, along with most other games published by Activision that had used the Marvel license, were de-listed and removed from all digital storefronts on January 1, 2014. As of July 15, 2015 the game was made available to purchase again on Steam. The game was re-released on November 18, 2015 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to coincide with the 2016 film of the same name.</p>
                
                <p class="zagolovok5">Gameplay</p>
                <p class="elo4">Deadpool is an action beat 'em up video game, with new combos becoming available to Deadpool as he progresses. The game, which is rated "mature", frequently breaks the fourth wall by having Deadpool verbally interact with the player based on their skill and progress. By default, Deadpool is armed with both guns and swords, but he also has access to giant hammers, plasma guns, and a range of other alternatives. A short range of teleportation moves are possible as well. As he slowly falls apart while sustaining damage, players must avoid further damage in order to recover.</p>

                        <p class="akka2"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty" aria-hidden="true"></span>Deadpool sets off explosives at High Moon Studios, forcing them to make "the most awesome game ever" starring himself; he even hires Nolan North as his voice actor. Messing around in his apartment, Deadpool has a script delivered to him; he finds it boring, so he uses crayon to rewrite it, preferring to improvise.Following the first few lines of the script, Deadpool sets out to assassinate corrupt media mogul Chance White. Deadpool storms White's media headquarters, slaughtering the guards before tackling himself and White out of the latter's penthouse window and into the sewers (apparently blowing the game's budget by repeating the events for kicks). But White is saved by the Marauders. Deadpool kills Arclight before finding the first of many glitches/unfinished areas throughout the game; he is forced to call High Moon to coerce them into finishing. Deadpool stumbles upon White meeting Mr. Sinister, who has Blockbuster kill him once informed that the mogul's satellites are under his control. This angers Deadpool as he lost his bounty, killing Vertigo and knocking out Blockbuster. But Mr. Sinister uses his powers to reduce Deadpool to a disembodied head, leaving him to regenerate unconscious.Deadpool awakens and encounters Wolverine, Rogue, Psylocke, and Domino of the X-Men. The X-Men follow Mr. Sinister to Genosha, but Deadpool insists on flying the Blackbird and crashes it, knocking everyone but himself unconscious (despite Deadpool's attempts to wake Wolverine by slapping him repeatedly and comically scolding him with nonsensical insults). While wandering through Genosha, Deadpool runs into Cable, who has come from the future to ensure that Sinister's plan does not succeed. But a bored Deadpool drowns out Cable's discussion with a bullet to the head, reviving to find a message from Cable about meeting "the incredibly hot and large-breasted naked fangirl who claims she's his number 1 fan". This convinces Deadpool to regroup with Cable, learning there is no fan girl.Deadpool then infiltrates a security tower housing Sinister against Cable's wishes and kills who he later learns to be a clone of Sinister. Cable convinces Deadpool to care about what happens if Sinister succeeds by telling him that his favorite taco restaurant will be destroyed along with the world. Reconfiguring a Sentinel foot into a flying machine to go to Magneto's citadel, Deadpool accidentally causes the foot to malfunction and crashes into Rogue in mid-air. After crashing, and getting his disembodied arm back from Mr. Shuggums, Deadpool goes to save Rogue from Blockbuster while hoping to seduce her. After a side trip where he ends up killing another Sinister clone, Deadpool takes out Blockbuster and saves an injured Rogue by letting her absorb his healing powers via kissing; Deadpool's extra personalities – screwball and serious – are also in Rogue's mind briefly.Deadpool briefly dies when Mr. Shuggums retrieves an explosive and he is reunited with his lover Death. Death tells Deadpool that Sinister had been exhuming mutant bodies to obtain their unique DNAs, and needs Deadpool to retrieve the suffering souls unable to pass on. Deadpool agrees as he comes back to life and, again meeting Cable, goes on a spirit quest to retrieve the souls for Death and cause the underground passage to cave-in, foiling Sinister's plans. After reuniting with Wolverine on the surface, Deadpool travels further into the citadel as he defeats clones of the Marauders and then a group of Mister Sinister clones. The real Mister Sinister later shows up and, after defeating the X-Men, Deadpool kills him by leaving him open to be squashed by the Sentinel foot. Deadpool wonders if he killed the real Mister Sinister until Cable gives thumbs up confirmation, allowing Deadpool to call out for the end credits.As Deadpool exudes joy over how awesome his game is after finishing playing it, High Moon's representative Peter Della Penna calls him and admits that he really hadn't blown their budget, at which Deadpool proceeds to actually do so by repeatedly creating explosions during the credits.<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty" aria-hidden="true"></span>

However, only a teaser trailer was shown; no platforms in which the game was to be released on were confirmed. Shortly after the announcement, an article was unveiled on Marvel's official website confirming the development of the game; the article was written from Deadpool's point of view, saying he hired High Moon Studios to make him a game. Prior to the game's release, the lead designer of the game revealed the basics of the plot in an interview with IGN, saying Deadpool has taken over the studio and is in charge of the game's development. The game was created using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 technology, which also powers Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. During High Moon's panel at Comic-Con, a censored version of the trailer was shown twice after an actor dressing up as Deadpool appeared on stage with the developers. Another marketing campaign started with billboards taking the appearance of graffiti covering advertisements for The Amazing Spider-Man, presumably made by Deadpool to crudely advertise his video game. GameSpot later released an advertisement of the game, with Deadpool giving a holiday greeting while telling people to pre-order the game, stating that it would be released in 2013.Peter Della Penna revealed later in a press release that Daniel Way had written the story for the game, bringing his signature Deadpool humor to the title. According to Penna, "We weren't actually planning on making a Deadpool game. But, Deadpool came by the studio one day, said he was taking over, and that if I didn't hire Marvel writer Daniel Way pronto and make the most amazing Deadpool video game, he'd break both of our arms and beat us to death with them. I have kids, so we're making the game."<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty" aria-hidden="true"></span>
