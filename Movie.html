                <p class="elo4">Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film directed by Tim Miller and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series, and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, Leslie Uggams and Brianna Hildebrand. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson hunts the man who nearly destroyed his life.Development began in February 2004 with New Line Cinema, but put the film in turnaround in March 2005, with 20th Century Fox buying the rights. In May 2009, after Reynolds portrayed the character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fox lent the film to writers, and Miller was hired for his directorial debut in April 2011. Enthusiastic acclaim from leaked CGI test footage by Miller in July 2014 led to Fox greenlighting the film in September. Additional casting began in early 2015, and principal photography commenced in Vancouver from March to May.Deadpool premiered in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released on February 12 in the United States in IMAX, DLP, D-Box and premium large format. The film was a massive blockbuster success, grossing over $782 million worldwide and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2016, and the highest-grossing R-rated film worldwide and X-Men film of all time; it also received generally positive reviews, with many praising its plot ,style, black humor, the cast performances especially Reynolds', dialogues as well as its action sequences. Shortly after its success, a sequel was greenlit by Fox.</p>

                                <p class="akka2"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool:A wisecracking mercenary who is subjected to an experimental regenerative mutation to cure his cancer, which gives him accelerated healing superpowers, but severely scars his body and makes his mind unstable. Reynolds called this version of Deadpool more "authentic" and closer to the comic version than his X-Men Origins: Wolverine version, saying that this Deadpool "takes nothing seriously."Like his comic book counterpart, Deadpool frequently breaks the fourth wall by often looking and speaking to the audience, commenting about production of the film, and referencing other Marvel films.
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Morena Baccarin as Vanessa: An escort and Wilson's girlfriend. Baccarin described her as "scrappy, she's not worried about her hair and her nails or messing around. She gets down and dirty and she's not a victim, she's not a damsel in distress."
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman / Ajax: An artificially-mutated member of Weapon X, the program that creates Deadpool. Ajax is a weapons expert, with enhanced reflexes and an inability to feel pain. According to Tim Miller, Skrein did "80%" of his own stunts, with stunt doubles only used for rigged stunts.
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> T. J. Miller as Weasel: Wilson's best friend who owns a bar. Describing the character, actor T. J. Miller said that Weasel "looks like his superhero power is spilling mustard on his shirt. Or who was bitten by a radioactive spider as a child". He initially attempted to give the character a facial tic, but director Tim Miller rejected the idea. On casting Miller, producer Simon Kinberg explained that the film has "a main character who is so outrageous and irreverent, we needed someone who could keep up with Ryan. We knew that T.J. would bring that."
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Gina Carano as Angel Dust: An artificially-mutated member of Weapon X who possesses superhuman levels of strength, stamina and speed. Carano was given "some room to play with" the characterization of Angel Dust, and said that the "character trusts Ajax with everything. She pretty much only really responds to him. He...kinda created me and showed me everything. And I do the same thing to everyone else."
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Leslie Uggams as Blind Al: An elderly blind woman and Deadpool's roommate. Uggams said that Al has "been through British Intelligence, she's done all kinds of wild and crazy things. She had sight at one time, but she lost her sight. But she's adjusted very well...she's old, but she's feisty." On Al's relationship with Deadpool, Uggams said that Al "loves being a part of" Wade's double life and "loves the danger part of him".
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead: A teenage X-Men trainee who possesses the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body. The writers chose to use the character based on her name, and changed her abilities from telepathic and precognitive powers to "a literal warhead because we thought it was funnier." To do this, they required permission from Marvel, with Miller talking directly with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to do so.
                                    <br> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-xs" aria-hidden="true"></i> Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus: An X-Men member with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel. The role was originally offered to Daniel Cudmore, who played the character in X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, and X-Men: Days of Future Past, but he declined. Instead, Colossus became a performance by several actors: Kapičić provided the voice, Andre Tricoteux provided the on-set performance, T. J. Storm provided the final body motion performance, motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle provided the final facial performance, and Glenn Ennis was used as "the inspiration for the chiseled jaw look behind the character".

For Deadpool's primary 'riffs', Holkenborg utilizes the ARP 2600 synth and a Synclavier, while an Oberheim was used for emotionally-focused scenes. A complete orchestra was used for the X-Men to give them a "noble" feeling and to honor the previous X-Men films. The film's soundtrack also incorporates several songs, including "Deadpool Rap" by YouTube personalities TeamHeadKick, inspired by the 2013 video game, but was revised to fit the movie's events instead. The soundtrack album was released digitally on February 12, 2016, and physically through Milan Records, on March 4, featuring both Holkenborg's score and songs from other artists that are used in the film.On April 27, a secondary soundtrack was released titled, Deadpool Reloaded: More Music From the Motion Picture which featured more tracks and remixes.

                                <p class="akka2"> In September 2015, Kinberg commented on the possibility of a sequel for Deadpool: "we were talking about the sequel while we were making the movie just because when you make a film like this that's from a serialized source material, you hope that it's the first of many". Fox gave the green-light to the film's sequel, with Reese and Wernick returning to write, and Miller being looked at to return as director. In April 2016, Fox confirmed the sequel's development, with Miller, Reese, Wernick and Reynolds returning. Kinberg and Miller have also talked about the possibility of a crossover featuring Spider-Man. The sequel will begin filming in early 2017. Kinberg told Slash Film that the sequel will comment on events from other superhero movies. On the August 12, 2016, Jeff Sneider stated that Kyle Chandler and Mackenzie Davis are being considered for Cable and Domino. Umberto Gonzalez revealed that Miller wanted Chandler to portray Cable, but the studio is interested in Liam Neeson for the role.
